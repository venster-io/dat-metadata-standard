# DAT Metadata Standard

A metadata standard for Distributed Artefact Tokens, or DATs.

## What's DAT?

**DAT**, which stands for **Distributed Artifact Token**, represents tokens that combine at least two smaller tokens. This composition enhances their efficiency by 90% in block space utilization while accommodating 50 times larger codebases.

Furthermore, DATs introduce a novel approach to instruct token viewers to fetch data from the blockchain. This capability enables the creation of token collections that are dynamic, evolving, and interconnected, unlocking new opportunities for artists to explore.

DATs can be fungible, semi-fungible, or non-fungible, and by embracing non-browser-based languages, they unlock many tools previously unavailable for creative coders to create on-chain generative tokens.
